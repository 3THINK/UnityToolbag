So you want to contribute to UnityToolbag. I appreciate it! However there are a couple guidelines:

1. If you're submitting bug fixes or _tiny_ feature changes, feel free to open up a pull request. I'm always happy to have people help keep things working.
2. If you're submitting big feature changes or entirely new features, please create a new repo (not a fork!) and put your code there. Then send a pull request adding your repository URL to the README.

The reason for the second guideline is not to be mean, but I want to ensure that the code in this repository is code that, generally speaking, I wrote. I also want to avoid having to be a manager of people who are going to want to make more pull requests to fix those new features or continue adding new things. Rather than put myself as a bottle neck, I'm making a new ruling that I won't be accepting third party features or tools anymore.

Again, nothing personal but I want to keep things nice and easy for everyone.
