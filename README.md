UnityToolbag
===

This repo is a host for any little Unity scripts I write that are simple and easy for others to leverage. Each folder will get its own README to explain the usage. All scripts are being written with the latest Unity 4.3 and may or may not work in earlier versions.

Usage
---

Simply clone the repository into the 'Assets' folder of a Unity project and you're good to go. If you're already using Git, you can use a submodule to check out into Assets without the Toolbag getting added to your repository.

Alternatively you can just cherry pick the features you want and copy only those folders into your project.
